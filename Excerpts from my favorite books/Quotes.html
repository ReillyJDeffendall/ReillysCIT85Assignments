<h1>Quotations From Aldous Huxley's Brave New World</h1>

<p>
    "And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen,
    why, there’s always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. 
    And there’s always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. 
    In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. 
    Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. 
    Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears—that’s what soma is." - Mustapha

    "One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn't dream about was this" <br><br>(he waved his hand),"us, the modern world.
    'You can only be independent of God while you've got youth and prosperity; independence won't take you safely to the end.' Well, we've now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. 
    What follows? Evidently, that we can be independent of God. 'The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.' But there aren't any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. 
    And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? 
    What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?" - Mustapha
